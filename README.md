- 👋 Hi, I’m Ore!
- 👀 I’m building [Fusion](https://usefusion.app/) a platform that brings together data on sleep, health vitals, screen time, and behaviour to provide insights into how they impact your lifestyle
- 📫 If you want to join me on this quest message me on - ore@usefusion.app
- ⚙️  I also maintain [eeg-notebooks]( https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) - a python project that allows you run neuroscience experiments from home using consumer EEG headsets
- 🌍 You can learn more about me on [oreogundipe.dev](https://oreogundipe.dev)
