- 👋 Hi, I’m Ore!
- 👀 I’m started an open source startup [NeuroFusion](https://usefusion.ai/) to collect changes in sleep, health vitals, screen time, and behaviour to inform daily decision making
- ⚙️  I also maintain [EEG-ExPy]( https://github.com/NeuroTechX/eeg-notebooks) - a python project that allows you run neuroscience experiments from home using consumer EEG headsets
- 📫 If you'd like to chat? ore@usefusion.app
